###  **What is Object Oriented Programming (OOPs)?**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is aprogramming paradigmin computer science that relies on the concept of classes and objects.It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints(usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects.

### **What are some benefits of using OOP inJ avaScript?**

Some benefits od using OOP in JavaScript includes: 
* Improved code organization (Structure of code)
* Reusability of code
* Better maintainability of code
* Closeness to real-world object

### **What is the difference between an object and a class in JavaScript?**

Object in JS is a standalone entity, with properties, methods and a type. It can be created directly from functions or through constructor functions. Class in JS acts as a blueprint for creating objects.

### **What is a constructor function in JS?**

Constuctor function is a special function that is used to create & initialize objects in JS. When a new object is created using a constuctor function, it is automatically assigned a set of properties and method that are defined within the funciton.

### **What is a prototype chain in JavaScript?**

Every object in JavaScipt has a built-in property, which is called its prototype. The prototype is itself an object, so the prototype will have its own prototype, making what's called a prototype chain. The chain ends when we reach a prototype that has null for its own prototype.

### **What is the difference between a constructor and a class in JavaScript?**

A constuctor is a function that create an object, while a class is a cluwprint for creating object. Classes define the framework whereas, contructor actually creates the object & initializes them.
(In JavaScript, classes are syntactic sugar over constructor functions.)

### **Why is the new keyword used in JavaScript?**

The 'new' keyword is used to create an instance of an object. When used with a constructor function, it creates a new object and sets the constructor function's 'this' keyword to point to the new object.

### **What is Inheritance in OOP?**

Inheritance in OOP us defined as the ability of a class to derive properties and characteristics form another class whicle having its own properties as well.

### **What is the 'super' keyword in JS?**

The super keyword in JavaScript acts as a reference variable to the parent class. It is mainly used when we want to access a variable, method, or constructor in the base class from the derived class.
